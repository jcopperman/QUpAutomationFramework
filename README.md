# QUp Test Automation Framework
A Selenium test automation framework that implements the Page Object Model pattern, with extra helpers for reading data from spreadsheets, a logger, html table reader, reporting and webservice helper. 

This framework supports SpecFlow, the BDD syntax documentation tool for .Net. 

A sample test project is included to demonstrate the use of the framework. 

TODOS:
Add a IJavascriptExecutor helper for console related tests, a screenshot helper for taking screenshots on failure
and support for headless browser automation
